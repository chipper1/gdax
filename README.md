# ðŸ“ˆ GDAX

A Crystal library for interacting with [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/)'s REST and WebSocket API's.

### Visit the [API Documentation](https://mccallofthewild.github.io/gdax/) for a more in-depth look at the library's functionality.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gdax:
    github: mccallofthewild/gdax
```

## Usage

Begin by requiring `"gdax"`.

```crystal
require "gdax"
```

### `GDAX::Client`
> Interact with the GDAX REST API 

`GDAX::Client` is derived from [HTTP::Client](https://crystal-lang.org/api/HTTP/Client.html). Use the inherited instance methods, `#get`, `#post`, `#put` and `#delete` to interact with GDAX's API. 
Responses are instances of [HTTP::Client::Response](https://crystal-lang.org/api/HTTP/Client/Response.html).

#### Basic
To authenticate, pass named argument, `auth` to the `GDAX::WebSocket` with a `GDAX::Auth` instance.
See [ _Authentication_ ](https://docs.gdax.com/#authentication) for help getting your `key`, `secret`, and `passphrase`.

NOTE: For security purposes, it is recommended that you store your `key`, `secret`, and `passphrase` as environment variables.

e.g.
```crystal
auth = GDAX::Auth.new ENV["CB-ACCESS-KEY"], ENV["API-SECRET"], ENV["PASSPHRASE"]
client = GDAX::Client.new auth
client.get "/products/BTC-USD/trades" do |response|
  puts response.body_io.gets_to_end
end
```

#### Unauthenticated
To instantiate an unauthenticated `Client`, simply don't pass the `auth` argument.

e.g.
```crystal
client = GDAX::Client.new
client.get "/products" do |response|
  puts response.body_io.gets_to_end
end
```

See [the API Documentation](https://mccallofthewild.github.io/gdax/GDAX/Client.html) for more information on `GDAX::WebSocket`.

### `GDAX::WebSocket` 
> Interact with the GDAX WebSocket Feed

#### Basic 
It's recommended that you [spawn a Fiber](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/guides/concurrency.html) around each `GDAX::WebSocket` you instantiate in order to achieve concurrency.

The following setup will give you access to GDAX's public _ticker_ stream.
```crystal
spawn do
  ws = GDAX::WebSocket.new production: true, subscription: {
    "type" => "subscribe",
    "channels" => [{ "name" => "ticker", "product_ids" => ["ETH-EUR"] }]
  }

  ws.run
end
Fiber.yield
```

#### `GDAX::WebSocket#on`
Use the `#on` method to add event listeners to a `GDAX::WebSocket`.

Events are based on [ _GDAX's message `type`'s_ ](https://docs.gdax.com/#protocol-overview).

`#on` takes in a `String` of the event to listen for and a block to call when the event is fired.
The block is passed two arguments: the first being the `JSON::Any` response data from GDAX, and the second being the event itself.

```crystal 
ws.on "subscriptions" do |data, event|
  puts "subscribed!"
end
```

Though event listeners _can_ be added dynamically on runtime, to avoid missing events, it is recommended that all listeners be added prior to invoking `GDAX::WebSocket#run`.

e.g.
```crystal
spawn do
  ws = GDAX::WebSocket.new production: true, subscription: {
    "type" => "subscribe",
    "channels" => [{ "name" => "ticker", "product_ids" => ["ETH-EUR"] }]
  }

  ws.on "subscriptions" do |data, event|
    puts "subscribed!"
  end

  ws.on "ticker" do |data, event|
    puts data["price"] #=> e.g. 264.10000000
  end

  ws.run
end
Fiber.yield
```

#### Authenticating
It is possible to authenticate yourself when subscribing to the websocket feed. See the [GDAX documentation on the subject](https://docs.gdax.com/#subscribe).

To authenticate, pass named argument, `auth` to the `GDAX::WebSocket` with a `GDAX::Auth` instance.
See [ _Authentication_ ](https://docs.gdax.com/#authentication) for help getting your `key`, `secret`, and `passphrase`.

NOTE: For security purposes, it is recommended that you store your `key`, `secret`, and `passphrase` as environment variables.

```crystal
spawn do
  auth = GDAX::Auth.new key: ENV["CB-ACCESS-KEY"], secret: ENV["API-SECRET"], passphrase: ENV["PASSPHRASE"]

  ws = GDAX::WebSocket.new production: true, subscription: {  
    "type" => "subscribe",
    "channels" => [{ "name" => "ticker", "product_ids" => ["ETH-EUR"] }]
  }, auth: auth
  
  ws.on "subscriptions" do |data, event|
    puts "subscribed!"
  end
  ws.run
end
```
